# Confirmations
When one of your deposit addresses recieves a transfer we immediately send the recieved amount after fees to your personal wallet. By choosing Confirmed you will recieve the event faster. But the transfer that is going to your personal wallet will be in the proccess of being finalized.

## Finalized vs Confirmed
Finalized means the all the validators agreed that this transaction is correct. This takes a bit of time *1 - 10 seconds*.

Confirmed means the network just acknowledged that transaction. Which is alot faster.
